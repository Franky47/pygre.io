PyGre.io
========

I'm proposing Python courses for free (as in beer), free (as in speech) and open to all,
in Grenoble, France. This repository holds the code of the website allowing people
to subscribe to the courses.

Tell me more !
--------------

The website is based on Tornado, and uses MongoDB for the users & calendar database.
The whole thing runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 at home.

The only personal data required to register for a course is an email address,
which will be used to send course updates to the students. First and last names
are optional, and any data sent through the website will be used strictly for
this purpose only (I don't do this for money and don't intend to sell your private
information to anyone).

Why is everything in English ?
------------------------------

Like most programming languages, Python's syntax is based on English.
The website is internationalised, and if you see a bad translation or want to contribute
to adding other languages, I'm gladly accepting pull requests.
